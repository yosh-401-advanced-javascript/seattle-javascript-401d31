## Overview
#### combineReducers
Reducers are great tools for defining state  and state changes to your applications. However as your application state gets more complex, your reducers become hard to manage. `combineReducers` is a redux method that enables you to create a single reducer from many reducers that define sub states and their interactions. a state returned from a combined reducer is an object where each _sub state reducer_ defines a property on that object.
