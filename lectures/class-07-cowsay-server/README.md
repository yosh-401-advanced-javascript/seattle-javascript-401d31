401 JS -- class 07 HTTP
===

## HTTP Resources
* Skim [Nodejs http module]
* Skim [Wiki list of header fields]
* Read [What is a rest api?]

## Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to identify qualities of the HTTP protocol
* Students will be able to implement an HTTP server using Nodejs
* Students will be able to explain what a HTTP RESTful is

## Overview
#### HTTP
* **HTTP** stands for hyper text transport protocol
* a stateless `request/response` protocol in the `client/server` computing model
* HTTP requests have
 * **METHOD** - used to indicate the type of action preformed on the resource
 * **URL** - used to indicate which resource to affect
 * **HTTP VERSION** - usually `HTTP/1.1`
 * **HEADERS** - used for optional request configuration
 * **MESSAGE BODY** - used with some **METHODS** to pass data to the server

* HTTP responses have
 * **HTTP VERSION** - usually `HTTP/1.1`
 * **STATUS CODE** - a number to indicate the requests success
 * **STATUS MESSAGE** - a name associated with the **STATUS CODE**
 * **HEADERS** - used for optional responses configuration
 * **MESSAGE BODY** - used to pass data back to the client

#### REST
* uniform interface
 * resources are identified by urls
 * actions are identified by methods
* stateless
 * the client and server to not maintain a connection for longer than request/response
* cacheable
 * responses must implicitly or explicitly define themselves as cacheable
* client-server
 * using client server architecture for thoughtfully dividing separation of concerns
 * servers store data
 * clients maintain user state and create the user interface
* layered system
 * clients can not tell how the backend is implemented
 * the server could be one server or it could be 1000, but the interface is the same
