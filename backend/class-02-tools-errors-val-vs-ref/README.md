## Learning Objectives
<!-- unordered list of learning objectives --> 

## Overview
#### package.json
* a package.json is a config file used for configuring metadata about a node project
* It only requires a name and version filed, but a typical package.json has much more inforamtion
* dependencies vs dev-dependencies
 * dependencies - a list of packages required to run the main program
 * dev-dependencies - a list of packages required to work on the project
* npm scripts are used to manage common tasks for working a node project  
* Setting up a project
 * create a new directory named after your project
 * navagate inside your directory
 * run `npm init` and answer the questions
 * now you should find a package.json inside your current directory :)

#### Gulp 
* Gulp is a tool that helps you automate time-consuming tasks that are a part of your dev workflow
* Gulp is configured in pure javascript, so you can use any node module in a gulp task
* Gulp has a awesome plugin ecosystem

#### Node Errors
###### Error 
* a generic error 
* `.stack` - a **String** describe the point in the code where the `Error` was instantiated
* `.message` - a **String** description set by calling the `new Error(message)`  

###### ReferenceError
* indicates that an attempt is being made to access a variable that is not defined
* `ReferenceError` is a subclass of `Error`  

###### SyntaxError
* indicates a program is not valid javascript
* `SyntaxError` is a subclass of `Error`  

###### TypeError
* indicates that a provided argument is not an allowable type
* `TypeError` is a subclass of `Error`    

###### SystemError
* `.code` - A **String** describing the error code
* `.errno` - A **Number** describing the error code
* `.syscall` - A **String** describing the syscall that failed
* `SystemError` is **not** a subclass of `Error`
* Common System Errors
 * `EACCESS` - An attempt to access a file without the right permissions
 * `EADDRINUSE` - An attempt to start a server on a PORT that is allready in use
 * `ECONNREFUSED` - A connection was deliberatly refused by the target machine
 * `ECONNRESET` - A connection was forcibly closed by a peer
 * `EEXIST` - A file exists and the attempted action required that it didnt
 * `EISDIR` - An action expected to act on a file but found a directory
 * `EMFILE` - To many files were open for your operating system to handle
 * `ENOENT` - An action expected a file, but did not find one
 * `ENOTDIR` - An action expected a directory, but found something else
 * `ENOTEMPTY` - An action expected an empty directory, but found one with data in it
 * `EPERM` - An attempt to do something that you currently dont have permissions to do
 * `EPIPE` - An attempt to write data to a connection that had been closed

###### Throw Try Catch
* If an un handled error is thrown in javascript the program will crash
* try catch blocks allow you to safely throw a an error and handle it
``` javascript
  // call an function that does not exist and the program will crash 
  let data = {};
  data.name();
```
``` javascript
// call a function that does not exists in a try block and handle the error in a catch block
try {
  let data = {};
  data.name();
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err.message);
}
```  
``` javascript
// explicly create and throw a custom error
try {
  let data = {name: 'adalove'};
  if (data.name !== 'ada lovelace')
    throw new Error('expected name to be "ada lovelace"');
} catch(err) {
  console.error(err.message);
}
```
