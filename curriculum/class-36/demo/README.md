# DEMOS - Context API

## Execution

Demos are provided in the `demo` folder in the guide repository. They are created with `create-react-app` and are suitable to install and run locally or at [Code Sandbox](http://codesandbox.io).  

At Code Sandbox, simply create a new app using "Git Hub" and point it at the the appropriate demo folder and it'll spin the app up for you. Saves a lot of time and also shows the students the value of doing quicker "POC" style work in an online IDE and then executing production code in their actual IDE.

## `context-api`

For this demo, the actual code being written is relatively small, but the concept is again pretty large.

Definitely spend plenty of time in pictures, drawing out the connections between the context provider and the components before you code it out. This should give you a good reference point to refer to as you write out the code.

The demo only needs a simple context provider with one bit of state and one modifier method. That will be enough to sell the concept and give the students the tools to build out their counter application.
