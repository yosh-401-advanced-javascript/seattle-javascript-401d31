Engaged collaboration</h3><li>When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone</li><li> It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work</li><li> Popping open your Facebook timeline is just that less enticing when someone else is looking at your screen</li><li>Another important aspect of learning to program is knowing when to ask for help</li><li> We advise our students to spend no more than fifteen minutes stuck on a problem before asking a teaching assistant or instructor for help</li><li> When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help</li><li> Ultimately, this boosts overall confidence</li><h3>3. Learning from fellow students</h3><li>Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of</li><li> If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution</li><li>Often times, the developers in a pairing have different skill sets</li><li> If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area</li><li> The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance, and the latter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding</li><h3>4. Social skills</h3><li>Pair programming is great for improving social skills</li><li> When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key</li><li> This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities</li><li> Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills</li><li> When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself</li><li>This has long-term career impacts</li><li> As much as employers want strong programmers, they know it’s essential to hire people who can work well with others</li><h3>5. Job interview readiness</h3><li>A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen</li><li> They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base</li><li> By doing so, companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style</li><li>For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills</li><li> Pair programming strengthens all of those skills</li><h3>6. Work environment readiness</h3><li>Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product</li><li> Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome</li><article><h2>6 Reasons for Pair Programming</h2><li>Iterative loops</li><li> Code reviews</li><li> Fast feedback</li><li> Error checking and linting</li><li> These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce</li><li> What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character?
