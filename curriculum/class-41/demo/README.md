====================================================================

## Snack Demo

* Head to your account at http://snack.expo.io
* Create a simple 2 screen app that passes some props around
  * Use multiple Views
  * Use routing and tab buttons
* Demo the UI at snack, how you can preview it there or launch it on your phone
* Get the whole class to download your app and run it on their phone


## Device Demo - `rna-demo`

This demo gets permission and reads the contact list.  Note that this will not work from Expo Snack, so you need to run this locally and send it to your phone

* Perform an install of expo-cli for the class `npm install -g expo-cli`
* Initialize an app `expo init demo-app`
* Start coding an app that fetches contacts from the phone and prints them on screen
* Note that the cli creates a web dashboard for you and also does the QR code system
* Get the whole class to download your app and run it on their phone - they should see their own contacts
