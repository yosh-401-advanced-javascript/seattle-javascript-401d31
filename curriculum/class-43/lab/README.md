# LAB - Javascript and Web Frameworks
 
 ## Before you begin
 Refer to *Getting Started*  in [lab-instructions.md](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.
 
 **Visualize the Application**
 
 Evaluate the lab requirements and begin with drawing a **UML** and/or **Data/Process Flow diagram**.  Having a solid visual understanding of the code you have/need and how it connects is critical to properly approaching this assignment.
 
 **Break Down the Assignment**
 
Once you have a good visual and mental model of how the application works, break down the requirements. For each requirement, ask your self the following questions:

* Where should this new code live in the codebase?
* What existing code needs to be modified?
* What dependencies will I need to install?
 
 **Map your priorities and dependencies before jumping into the code.**

## Getting Started

## Group Assignments
* [Angular 1.3](https://angular.io/) - (student list here)
* [Angular (latest)](https://angularjs.org/) - (student list here)
* [Adonis](https://adonisjs.com/) - (student list here)
* [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - (student list here)

## Before you begin
* Visit and familiarize yourself with the [ToDo MVC Project](http://todomvc.com)
* Create a new repository for your work, with the name of the framework you have been assigned.

## Assignment
For the purposes of educating your class/teammates, your group will research and implement a "To Do" application using your assigned framework, with the appropriate features from ToDo MVC. The goal is to provide some analysis to your team as to the general viability of the framework. 

### Stretch Goals:
* Deploy your running appliation to either Heroku or Amazon
* Repeat the process, recreating the socket.io chat applet

###  Documentation
Complete the README.md file included in the lab folder

### Presentation
Prepare a presentation (10-15 minutes) that details the implemention requirements of your framework. Format this as a mini-lecture, with the mindset being that your task is to quickly "spin up" a small team of developers to implement a new feature in this framework.

Give us just enough information for us to "go on" so that we could reproduce your work without having to feel the pain of R&D that you went through.
