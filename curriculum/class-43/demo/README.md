# DEMOS - Javascript Frameworks

This is a "have fun" day for the instructor.  The studens are about to start a 2 day mini-project implementing different frameworks on their own.

As instructors, this is a great opportunity to show them how to proceed by walking them through any framework or system that you like, so long as it's not JS based...

Implement a hello-world/counter app in:

* PHP
* Ruby
* Perl/CGI

Show off and have some fun.

* Use the framework of your choice to fulfill the counter app requirements
* **DO NOT** simply shred it out!
* Follow the process you laid out for them in lecture, even if you know the framework.
  * Do some research
  * Find the docs
  * Download sample code
  * Run the tests
  * Step through it
  * Follow a tutorial
* Once you've made it clear that 'you got it' ... build something!
