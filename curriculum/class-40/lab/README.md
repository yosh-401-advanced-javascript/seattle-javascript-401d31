# Block 7 Project: Database Dashboard

## Overview

## Before you begin
Refer to *Getting Started*  in [lab-instructions.md](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

**Visualize the Application**

Evaluate the lab requirements and begin with drawing a **UML** and/or **Data/Process Flow diagram**.  Having a solid visual understanding of the code you have/need and how it connects is critical to properly approaching this assignment.

**Break Down the Assignment**

Once you have a good visual and mental model of how the application works, break down the requirements. For each requirement, ask your self the following questions:

* Where should this new code live in the codebase?
* What existing code needs to be modified?
* What dependencies will I need to install?

**Map your priorities and dependencies before jumping into the code.**

---

## Getting Started

* Ensure that your API server is deployable to Heroku
* Ensure that your Queue server is deployable to Heroku
* You may have a previous deployments out there. Validate
* Open this [Starter Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/z6mpqy858m) and Fork it

## Requirements

For this assignment, you will be creating a database dashboard so that the members of your DBA team can monitor database activity in real time.

Your react application will be conneced to the Q server you build in Block 4. It will connect to the `database` queue and subscribe to `create`, `update`, and `delete` events. For each event, update the UI to indicate the collection that was affected, the event type, the time, and the ID of the record.  You may optionally display additional information.

You should give careful consideration to the visual layout of your application, color choices, animations, and overal usability.

* Use a visualizer (charts, graphs, etc) to display realtime database information
* Use the `@nmq/q/client` library in your React application
* Use **context** and/or **hooks** to manage state
* Perhaps use *redux* or *useReducer()* to manage complex state...

### Notes - Q Server
* Deploy the server to Heroku and validate that you can connect and subscribe to events.
* Listen on `process.env.PORT`
  * Heroku will assign you a port
* Listen on a queue called `database`
* Montior the following events: `create`, `read`, `update`

### Notes - API Server
* Deploy the server to Heroku
* Listen on `process.env.PORT`
  * Heroku will assign you a port
* Alter your API server to connect to the Q server at startup
* Edit your models and make the following changes
  * Add "post" hooks for `save`, `delete` 
  * For each, publish a new event to the Q server
  * Make sure and publish separate events for `create` and `update`, not just `save`
  
### Notes - Connections
* Ensure that you can use `Postman` or `httpie` to hit your server properly.
  * Ensure that all write actions publish the appropriate event and payload into the queue.
  * You can use Postman and your original "logger" client to do this.
  * Once you are confident in the wiring, begin work on the react client.
