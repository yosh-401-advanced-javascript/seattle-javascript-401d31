# LAB - Component Based UI

Create a counter application using React

## Before you begin
Refer to *Getting Started*  in [lab-instructions.md](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

**Visualize the Application**

Evaluate the lab requirements and begin with drawing a **UML** and/or **Data/Process Flow diagram**.  Having a solid visual understanding of the code you have/need and how it connects is critical to properly approaching this assignment.

**Break Down the Assignment**

Once you have a good visual and mental model of how the application works, break down the requirements and assess how to apply each requirement to your model.

 * For Each Requirement, ask yourself questions such as:
   * Where should this new code live in the codebase?
   * Which existing code needs to be modified?
   * Are there any dependencies that this feature requires

**Map your priorities and dependencies before jumping into the code.**

## Getting Started

## Requirements

* Visit the Sandbox containing the [Lab Starter Code](https://codesandbox.io/s/06r02vr7w) and FORK it.
* Move the `Header` and `Footer` components to separate files
* Properly `export` them as defaults
* Import them into the `App` Component using ES6 `import` statement
* Convert the `Header` component to an ES6 Class
* Rename the `Main` component to `Counter` and render it properly
* Change the state declaration to track a `counter` instead of `stuff`
* Change the button handler to increment the counter instead of returning a random number.
* Add a second button that, when clicked, would decrement the counter
* Convert the buttons to links


### Design Implementation
* Create a file called `app.scss` and `import` that into the `App` component
* Add some cool styling for the header, making use of SASS nesting
* Alter the `app.scss` as follows:
  * Alter your css rules to use a variable (i.e. $backgroundColor)
  * Start getting creative about styling the basic layout of the app
    * Might things change when the counter is > 0 or < 0?
    * Where would the buttons look best?
    * Can you make the number "pop"
