# Test Your Adorable Animal Photo Album
Add testing for your photo album directives. 

Split your tests so that you have separate test file for each of your directives, and at least one test per directive (although most likely you will need more). 

For this assignment you only need to worry about unit tests. Pay special attention to how the scope is being manipulated by the directive and what changes to the directive are caused by function calls.
